Sentiment Analysis 
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using the nltk library, sklearn, and Hugging Face's Transformers pipeline. The dataset used is the NLTK-provided movie reviews dataset. It includes steps for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and sentiment prediction. Additionally, it compares traditional machine learning approaches with a modern transformer-based pipeline.
Features
Preprocessing of movie reviews using:
Lemmatization
Stopword removal
Punctuation removal
Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF vectorization techniques
Sentiment classification using Logistic Regression
Sentiment prediction on new text using Hugging Face's pre-trained transformer model
